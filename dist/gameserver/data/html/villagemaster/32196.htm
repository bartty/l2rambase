Come in, fearless warrior Kamael. My name Gershwin, I'm responsible for the Kamael Guild. It must have been smiling at me luck, since I met a representative Kamael in these strange lands. I would like to proudly show you the village.<br>
In any case, you picked me up, thank you. Tell me, if you want to know something. I'll try to help.<br>
