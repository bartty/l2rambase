<html><head><body>Head Blacksmith Mendio:<br>
I am chairman of the Guild of the Black Anvil in Gludin, Chief Blacksmith mehndi. Without our Black Anvil Guild of human civilization can be considered absolutely wild. Without us, you would have lost everything in some next great battle, or holy war. Empty talk. If not for Golems and weapons that we manufacture, humanity would have fought hand to hand.<br>
Quietly, on what business you came to me?<br>
