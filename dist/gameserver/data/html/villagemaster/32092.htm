<html><body>Warehouse Chief Alder:<br>
I am Warehouse Chief Alder of the Iron Gate Guild here in Schuttgart. Ah! I cannot abide the chaos I see racing through the world like a forest fire in summer.<br>
It's bad enough that the races should war with each other, but each of them is also riven by infighting and discord. How can ordinary folk like us even summon the courage to crawl out of bed each morning?<br>
If there's one thing that I've learned in my life, it's that everyone, regardless of race, really wants a prosperous life. That should naturally lead them to engage in commerce and trade.<br>
And as long as that's so, craftsmen the world over will want to learn their art from us Dwarves, the undisputed masters of craftsmanship. That's why we will never fade from the world -- we're too useful to it!<br>
