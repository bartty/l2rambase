You want to be certified for level <?LEVEL?>?<br1>
You do realize that once you're 
certified you can't be recertified unless 
you go through a specialized process to 
cancel the certification, Right? Even if 
you delete the class and build up you 
skill level, you still have to cancel the 
certification first.<br>

All right then. Now that we've got that 
out of the way, do you still want to 
receive certification?<br>
