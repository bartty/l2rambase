Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>

Once you reach a certain level of skill in your dual class, you skills can be certified.

As a result, you will be able to learn some special skills which you can use in your main class and dual class.

That means that even if you come back with a different occupation for the subclass, you cannot obtain another certification unless you first spend a *huge amount to cancel the first certification*.

If you want to obtain a certification, *your current occupation has to be Dual Class, and you should be above level 85*.

Now, do you wish to be certified for this Dual Class?
