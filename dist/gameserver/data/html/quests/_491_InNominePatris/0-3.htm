Goddard Vanguard Sirik:
<br>
Hahaha. No, babysitting this guy isn`t the 
problem.
<br>
These creatures all around us though, those are 
the problem. You see I`m not a very skilled 
Vanguard member. I`m much better at running 
away than fighting. But I can`t run with this guy 
around. If he dies, then my father is going to be 
super mad at me.
<br>
I need someone to help protect me so I can 
protect him... which I guess is pretty much the 
same as protecting him.
