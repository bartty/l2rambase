!Guard:
Oh, you must be new around here. If you don't 
mind a few pointers from an old hand...? Well, I 
couldn`t help but notice that when you used your 
weapon, there was no flash of light. I don`t mean 
to overstep my bounds if you know this already, 
but it makes things so much easier when you 
use *Soulshots*. Here, let me give you a few. Do 
you know how to use them?
