!Evain:
<br>
Are you ready? I want to tell you more about the 
task.
<br>
I want you to defeat the Husk Crawlers in the 
Training Grounds Underground Facility. First you 
must take the key I gave you to *Holden* at the 
*Training Grounds Underground Facility Entrance*. 
Tell him you`ve come to defeat the Husk 
Crawlers, and he`ll let you in.
<br>
If you lose key, come back to me. Once 
you`ve defeated all the Husk Crawlers, report to 
*Shannon* at the *Training Grounds*.
