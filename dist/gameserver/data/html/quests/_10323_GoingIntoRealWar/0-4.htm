<br>
Did you forget your mission? It`s to defeat the 
Husk Crawlers in the Military Compound!
<br>
First you must take the key I gave you to *Holden* 
at the *Military Compound Entrance*. Tell him 
you`ve come to defeat the Husk Crawlers, and 
he`ll let you in.
<br>
If you lose key, come back to me. Once 
you`ve defeated all the Husk Crawlers, report to 
*Shannon* at the *Training Grounds*.
