Grand Master Devon:

It seems to me that you are still insufficiently strongâ€¦ To entrust to your fulfillment of assignments as a result of the limits of city is thus far somewhat early. But I want to help you to as fast as possible open your potential. You are capable down much. Now important - not to forget time, not to lose its chance.

The task, which I will charge to you this time, will be the first testing. You remember, you must manage, this is directly connected for the sake of your future.
