<html><head><body>Grand Magister Rivian<br>Excellent. I'm glad. Now, hurry to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira entrance</font> and you'll meet Searcher <font color="LEVEL">Lakcis</font>. Help him investigate the ruins, and we'll consider your promise honored.<br>Oh, you can find <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Richard</font> near the fountain here. He can send you straight to the Saghira relics, if you wish to get around a little faster.<br>Good luck!</body></html>
