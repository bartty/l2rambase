Lakcis:
<br>
Oh! The Labyrinth of Belis, a terrifying lair that's home to the 
largest of the monsters, is in *Exploration Zone 5*. 
You'll find it at the end of the ruins, along with the ranger 
*Sebion*. Ask him, and he'll let you enter the labyrinth.
<br>
I'll send you to Exploration Zone 5, if you're ready?
