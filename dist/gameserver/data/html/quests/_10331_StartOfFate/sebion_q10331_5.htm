Sebion:

You do speak, before Smeryu it did have time to transfer the forces of evil, which did not have time to the end to wake up, somewhere beside another place? It cannot beat!!! It is necessary urgently to report this beside the city!

Now leave at the point of *Museum*, find *Panteon* and describe to it everything! And still… The necklace, which you found… It belonged to Saril. Return it to pantheon.

Use *Scroll of Escape*, it will teleport you to the village.
