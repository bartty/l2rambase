Grand Master Valfar:

As you know, the speaking island very strongly changed after a drop in the celestial island of giants. Recently there awoke the forces of evil, which existed even before the times of giants. To now be located is very dangerous as a result of the city. Studies of the ruins of YeSagira are not yet finished. There they directed several members of scouting force.

It would be a good thing, if you, disregarding on the danger, as the member of reconnaissance expedition left at the point of the depths of the ruins of YeSagira, at the point of the labyrinth of Belis, and they were dismantled with the situation there. I promise to *change your profession* you will after complete this task. You do assume my proposal?
