Sebion:
<br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up there! This place is dangerous--someone died in here recently. 
We can't let just anyone go walzing in and out. Ahh...
You're the ranger dispatched from the town. You can go on your way, 
but you'll want to know a couple of things first.
<br>
I haven't been able to investigate, because I'm recovering from an injury,
 but there've been rumors of strangers going in and out of the underground 
 area, and also of suspicious intruders in the Museum. Are these things 
 linked?
