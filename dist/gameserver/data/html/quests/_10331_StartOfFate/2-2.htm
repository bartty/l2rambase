<html><head><body>Sebion:<br>They showed up a few weeks ago, a group of humans acting secretive and weird. I followed them into the Labyrinth and spied on them a bit, long enough to see that they had a large Evil Fragment.<br>There was one, who seemed to be the leader, doing some kind of magical ritual on the fragment. Probably trying to hatch it. Can you even imagine what will happen if they manage that? The whole place might collapse again. This is why I sent to town for help, and it seems like you're the one they dispatched. So, what do you say? Will you help me?<br>[Quest _10331_StartofFate preinstance_talk|"That's what I'm here for."]</body></html>
