Thank you! Thanks to you we were able to overcome the crisis. But you can not relax. These creatures Shilen and will climb out of the Tomb. We now have a free minute, so I can introduce myself to you. My name is Zenia, Assistant Tetrarch Kamael Village. <br>
The village where I lived, was burned to the ground by order of Shilen. Then we with my friends barely managed to escape. We lost their homeland and dispersed throughout the world in all directions. I recently learned that his creatures Shilen ordered to gather the strength to revive her. <br>
In what may become necessary to prevent her to be reborn. If the goddess reborn, this world will fill the die. Our overall mission is greater than the racial interests. So after some time I again ask you for help.</body></html>
