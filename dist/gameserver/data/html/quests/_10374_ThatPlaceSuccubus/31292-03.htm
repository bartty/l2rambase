Hmm? I told Agnes about it. To her came wandering Kamael, told everything, and asked for help. Of course, we do not know if this is true. But to pretend that nothing has been heard, we were not able to. In any case, these space monsters will become greater, and our strength will undergo a serious danger. But we can not just rely on itinerant Kamael, and go there ... The difficult situation. <br>
Maybe you check for us all? Truth told, these Kamael or not.<br>
