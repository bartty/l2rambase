!Quartermaster:

Together with his soldiers of advance guard Adolf conducts furious fighting with the monsters,
completed breakthrough and attacking Aden. Because of our victory now the advance guard leaves at the point of the base of monsters, 
but in the course of battle many perished.

The delay of death similarly, and as this not is lamentable, we do not manage even to gather based on the bodies family relics in order to send to their heirs before the metropole.
I please you to gather on the cemetery 4 relics based on the bodies of the fallen soldiers of the advance guard of Aden and to bring them to me.

The bodies of soldiers are scattered throughout the entire zone Of [kladbishchya]; therefore we could not explain them 
precise location, but it is, it seems, necessary to inspect the section, whose angles are formed
Central fountain, the statue of angel and pagoda.
