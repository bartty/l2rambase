!Quartermaster:

I please you to gather on the cemetery 4 relics based on the bodies of the fallen soldiers of the advance guard of Aden and to bring them to me.

The bodies of soldiers are scattered throughout the entire zone Of [kladbishchya]; therefore we could not explain them 
precise location, but it is, it seems, necessary to inspect the section, whose angles are formed
Central fountain, the statue of angel and pagoda.
