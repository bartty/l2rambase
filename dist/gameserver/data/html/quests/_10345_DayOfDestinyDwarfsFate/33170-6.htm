!Chief of the advance guard of Aden Adolf:

This ring I obtained based on [Orvena]. He commanded to me to lend to his that, whom I will consider sufficiently 
capable for the forthcoming battle.

This is the [chudestnoe] ring, which wakes up the concealed abilities of owner. It is worthwhile at the point of you to put on it, and you will be able to use a part of that enormous 
force, which at the point of you one must obtain
subsequently. 

Thus, if you are ready, try completely to put an end to a constant inflow of evil.
