Priest Ross:

I see you have returned with the Blazing Swamp 
Ash as requested. Thank you for helping making 
the Blazing Swamp a safer area. Hopefully one 
day it will be safe enough that I may make my 
pilgrimage to help bring those brave warriors of 
Aden peace and rest.

Here is your paymaent. Please feel free the 
contact the Adventurer Helper tomorrow if you 
wish to help again.
