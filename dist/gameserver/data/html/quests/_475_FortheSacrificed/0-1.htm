<br>
Any adventurers dyung to visit the Blazing 
Sawmp? Wait, I read that wrong... plan on dying 
when you visit the Blazing Swamp.
<br>
Everyone knows the tale of the legendary battles 
that took place in the Blazing Swamp when King 
Amadeo`s armies destroyed their enemies during 
the Aden Elmore Wars. While they saw victory, 
many died and found their final resting place 
withing the lava filed swamp.
<br>
Now the swamp is filed with creatures preventing 
those who wish to pay their respects to the fallen 
heroes.
