Adventurer Helper:
<br>
Once you have killed a creatures you need to 
gather their ash as soon as possible as Priest 
Ross requires *30 Blazing Swamp Ash* as proof you 
have cleared some of the monsters in the 
Blazing Swamp. Once you have them return 
them to *Priest Ross in Aden`s Einhasad Temple*. 
He`ll then pay you for your work.
<br>
Any questions?
