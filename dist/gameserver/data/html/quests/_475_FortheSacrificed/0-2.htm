Adventurer Helper:
<br>
Now need to be rude, I was merely setting the 
stage to tell you about the work order that is 
available if you wish to take it. Priest Ross has 
been preparing for a pilgrimage to comfort the 
souls of the dead Aden soldiers so they may find 
rest. Unfortunately, the Blazzing Swamp is full of 
creatures and the Priest is not able to make the 
journey on his own.
<br>
He is hoping that he can hire adventurers to go 
out and hunt creatures to defeat *Judge of Marsh*, 
*Tulben, Glow Wisp, Hames Orc Scout, Marsh* 
*Predator, Conjurer, Lava Wyrm, Hames Orc* 
*Footsoldier, Conjurer Bat Lord, Hames Orc* 
*Sniper, Cursed Guardian, Hames Orc Shaman,* 
*and Hames Orc Overlord* there.
