Sebion:
<br>
You've really gotten the monsters in the 
Ruins under control. I mean, there are still 
some about, but it's not nearly so bad. I'm 
just waiting for my replacement to come, so I 
can head back to town and concentrate on 
recovering. But before I go, I have one 
more favor to ask of you.
