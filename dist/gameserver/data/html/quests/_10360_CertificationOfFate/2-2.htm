<html><head><body>Guard Joel:<br>What? Master? Ahh.. You must be dispatched as a special supporter in order to catch Sakum. It seems like your abilities are sufficient - after all you caught Kanilov! <br>But, before you catch Sakum... I want you to defeat Sakum's other self, Poslof. The bio-energy, which is absorbed by Poslof, will affect Sakum if it is absorbed by him instead. We must kill Poslof first! <br>[Quest _10360_CertificationOfFate 2-3.htm|"I'm on it!"]</body></html>
