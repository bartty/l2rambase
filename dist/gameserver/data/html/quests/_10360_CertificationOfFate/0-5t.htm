Grand Master Tobias:
<br>
I heard about you from Guards Wasteland. You are so
quickly destroyed Sakuma ... To be honest, I
amazed. I want to thank you on behalf of all
local residents. Sakuma Razbudiv≈°ego Embryo
have not yet found, but I don't think you need much
worry in this regard.
<br>
Now I'm going to change your profession, as promised.
<br>
Tell me what kind of job do you want to select.
