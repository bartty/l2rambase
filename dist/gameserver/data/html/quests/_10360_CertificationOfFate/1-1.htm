<html><head><body>Guard Renfad:<br>You must be here to defeat Sakum! But... perhaps... Did you come here alone? Sigh.. I see the lord has not come back yet. <br>We need the likes of Black-haired Kenshu, Aether Eye Raphienl, and the Witch of the Battlefield Seyraka! It's apparently impossible to get help from Gludio's best knights.<br>Still, it's up to us to make the best of the hand we've been dealt. You defeated the monsters very quickly last time, but Sakum is something else. Do you really think you can defeat him? <br>[Quest _10360_CertificationOfFate 1-2.htm|"I wouldn't be here otherwise."]</body></html>
