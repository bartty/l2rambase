You got the strength Giant, this is awesome! But you still do not understand why you became the owner.

Do you know what * Increase Strength *? The subject retains the basic skills, once acquired. If the change is seen as a revival or development, the increase in strength can be considered subject to obtaining the Giant strength.

I - spicules. Create giants. As a sign of respect your strengths ... I will increase the strength of your subclass to demonstrate your capabilities.
