Let me test the strength of your soul with a task.It is rumored that the frequent wars in Aden and Rune Castle have clouded those regions natural aura.Here is a Helping Seed to helpyou purify those lands.Please return after planting the Helping Seed in <font color="FFFF00">the regions shrouded by green fog</font>near ether <font color="FFFF00">Aden Castle</font> or <font color="FFFF00">Rune Castle</font>.You simply target the Helping Tree Summon Device in the midst of the green fog,and use the Helping Seed.It will grow into a Helping Tree.

A Helping Tree will purify its surroundings and give you <font color="FFFF00">Ashes of Remnants.</font> Bring those to me.

Oh,and I will give you a <font color="FFFF00">Scroll of Escape for enther Aden or Rune Castle.</font>Don't lose it,for I will only give it once.
