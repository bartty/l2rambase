Thank you!A total of <font color="FFFF00">4 ingrendients</font> are needed in order to make a weapon to purity the waters.


First please bring us <font color="FFFF00">greenish hot spring water in the hot springs.</font>I will give you a bottle, so you can bring the water in there. If you go to the <font color="FFFF00">greenish hot spring</font> in the Hot Springs and <font color="FFFF00">double click this bottle</font>, water will fal the bottle.

<font color="FFFF00">If you then bring the water back</font>I will be able to give you a summoning stone. <font color="FFFF00">Double click this summoning stone</font> to summon my subordnate, the <font color="FFFF00">Water Spirit Lanya.</font> Use this summoning stone, to receiv missions from me.

I will also give you a <font color="FFFF00">Scroll of escape</font>,Which can take you straight to the Hot Springs.But you should be careful--you cannot receive it again if you lose it!
