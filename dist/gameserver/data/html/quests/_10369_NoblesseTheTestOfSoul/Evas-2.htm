You probably know that Shilen has been resurrected, But did you also know that Shilen was the Goddess of Water before she became a fallen goddess?What she became the Goddess of Destruction, the power of water came to me.


However,since her resurrection,the waters have been getting increasingly contaminated due to the infuence of her power.


I should purity this contamination as the current Goddess of Water.However, I cannot reach to all the tainted locations,and need your help.

Can you help me?
