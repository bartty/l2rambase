Eva's Spirit Lanya:

You can get <font color="FFFF00">Hard Fossis Containing Water Energy</font>on the <font color="FFFF00">Isle of Preyer</font> in the Innadril Territory.The isle is filed with Water Energy.

You can get Hard Fossis Containig Water Energy by catching <font color="FFFF00">Seycheties, Naiads, Sonneratias, Castalias, Chrysocolas, and Pythias</font> on the Isle of Prayer.

Bring <font color="FFFF00">10</font> of them or so.The isle is very far,so I'll give you a <font color="FFFF00">Scroll of Escape for teleporting to the Isle of Player.</font>Don't lose it,because you won't get another one!
