It is unclear what happened, so that further research we can not. But we have managed to do very much, and do not want to throw it all in the middle. One of the victims before death had a strange phrase to say to us ... "The king woke up." King, which he said ... I think this is the Harnack, the king of ancient giants. But he died long ago! Nature does not make exceptions ... So, I think the problem is something else. <br>
I would like to ask you to find out that the creature attacked our scouts in the Underground Ruins, and destroy them. Then we can continue our research. I suspect that it could be a ghost Harnack. <br>
