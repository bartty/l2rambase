Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:
<br>
You can find *Atran* at the *crossroads, on the way from the 
village to Ye Sagira*. Don't let his gruff exterior fool you, 
he talks like an ogre, but he's sweet as spun candy at the 
core.
<br>
If you tell him I sent you, he'll tell 
you how to get to Ye Sagira. May the 
luck of Pa'agrio always find you.
