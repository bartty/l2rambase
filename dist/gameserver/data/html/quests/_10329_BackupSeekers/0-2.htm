Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:
<br>
The Evil Fragments continue to spread. 
It's beginning to be a toss up whether 
we're doing archaeology or parasite 
control over in the ruins. I'd love to 
send over some reinforcements, but we've 
had a rash of monster attacks in the 
village, so I can't just reassign troops.
<br>
Could you head on over to Ye Sagira and help out? 
<br>
