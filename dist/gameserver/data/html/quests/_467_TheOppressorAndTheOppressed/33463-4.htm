Magister Desmond:

All right. To sum up a minute.

We must destroy <font color="LEVEL"> Kranrot, Paliote, Yintzu, Hamrut</font>,
collect <font color="LEVEL"> 30 Pure Legacy Cores </font> and take them <font color="LEVEL"> Magister Desmond
located in Aden </font>. So now time for you to move to the Forgotten Plains for the job.
You understand? Long live the journey!
