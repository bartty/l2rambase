Grocer Vollodos:

We have a few surviving Dark Elves are now developing drugs.
But I'm not a scientist and not a magician, so little I can do ... All I can - extract
materials necessary for the investigation, killing monsters that live nearby.

My own strength is not enough to fight monsters, so I appeal
help from strangers passing by.
