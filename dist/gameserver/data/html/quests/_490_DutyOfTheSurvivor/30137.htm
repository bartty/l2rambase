Grocer Vollodos:

Have you ever been to the Dark Elves village?

Ah ... So it bothers me. Because of the awakening of the Shillien many relatives of mine were killed,
and those who survived were forced to flee the village. They say that the epidemic has swept the entire continent.
Look! You see a dark mist, covering all around? It seems to me that soon all of us will come to an end.
