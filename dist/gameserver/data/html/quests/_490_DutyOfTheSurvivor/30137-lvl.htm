Grocer Vollodos:

The epidemic has swept the entire continent. Look! You see a dark mist, covering all around?
If you walk around, you can get sick and die.

Due to special circumstances I can't leave this place, so I can't show you the way.
I hope you manage to get to a safe place.

(This quest is available after reaching level-85.)
