Grocer Vollodos:

The problem is not that all try to escape to a safe place, such as
Talking Island. They say many people can't find a place to escape and died from a strange disease.
In this area there are also a lot of accidents. Deaths will be more and more if we do not
will take anything.

Survivors must help others. Could you help me?
