Adventurer Helper:
<br>
Hear ye! Hear ye!
<br>
Akk adventurers planning to visit the *Shrine of* 
*Loyalty* must be aware of the following 
information. The place is not safe - though it was 
once widely visited by Aden`s warriors and 
mages, distant wars have drastically reduced the 
number of visitors. This hase led to the native 
monsters growing in both strenght and number, 
something that *Priest Bastian* wishes to see 
remedied.
<br>
All willing to help should speak to me for further 
details.
