Thank you! First you need to take the animals to the Cave of the Roses, so that they breathed fragrance. And then you need to collect 20 samples of animal blood. Of course, if you are someone will disturb, destroy it. The most important thing - it samples. You can first destroy animals, and then collect samples. I hope for you.
