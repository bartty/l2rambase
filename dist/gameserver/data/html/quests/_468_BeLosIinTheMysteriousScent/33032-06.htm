You have collected blood samples? Thank you! Nothing special happened during the quest? What? Say, they are not asleep, paralyzed by their smell? Hmm, I even think about this could not. <br>
Well, okay. Anyway, I was right in thinking that the smell of Rose Caves somehow affects animals. I will send these samples to Aden and ask to conduct the study. Thank you! <br>
