I need your help to find out the secret of Gardeners Management animals. Recently, I saw something. If there are uncontrollable animals, one of the gardeners takes them to the Cave of the Roses. As soon as they smell the roses, but became quiet and go to sleep. I'm sure they are acted smell. For research necessary to obtain blood samples from the animals asleep, you go into this cave. I wish that you just extracted samples.<br>
