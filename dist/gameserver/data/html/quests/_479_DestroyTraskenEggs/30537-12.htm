!Priest of the Earth Daichir:

I will repeat once again - this is important. <font color="LEVEL">Eggs Earth Worm usual way is not consumed.</font>
They are protected with a special shell, which can be destroyed only by specially appointed with insecticide.

All of them there are three types of. Earthworm lays <font color="LEVEL">three types of</font> eggs.
For the destruction of eggs each species should be used <font color="LEVEL">a particular insecticide</font>.
They say that if you use the wrong type of insecticide, it will cause in the egg internal metamorphosis,
which will lead to the change of its kind... as well as the complete recovery of health.

And know that <font color="LEVEL">egg can be destroyed only after three-time application of the insecticide.</font>
As you can see, the destruction of Eggs Earth Worm - hard work, which requires well-coordinated team work.

Keep this in mind.
