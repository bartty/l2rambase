!Priest of the Earth Daichir:

The matter is that the <font color="LEVEL">kill the eggs, which earthworm put in its nest</font>.
Because as soon as the battle with the monster, from eggs climb Larvae, which will be let You fight.
If not destroy masonry, we will not be able to win Trasken.

By the way, consider the fact that hatch from the eggs, Larvae may eventually grow...
Do you imagine? Instead of one Earth Worm Trasken we will have to deal with hundreds of others like him!
So here's my advice: destroy <font color="LEVEL">Eggs Earth Worm</font> everywhere, where they will see.

Not to say, however, that it is easy to do...
