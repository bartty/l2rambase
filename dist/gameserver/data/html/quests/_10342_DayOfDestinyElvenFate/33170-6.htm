!Chief of the advance guard of Aden Adolf:

This ring was left to me down the storage. Me they ordered to entrust to his that, whom I will consider sufficiently to capable for the forthcoming battle.

This is the [chudestnoe] ring, which wakes up the concealed abilities of owner. It is worthwhile at the point of you to put on it, and you will be able to use a part of that enormous 
force, which at the point of you one must obtain
subsequently. 

Thus, if you are ready, try completely to put an end to a constant inflow of evil.
