!Chief of the advance guard of Aden Adolf:

We recently returned from the heavy fighting and 
they were going to die. I believe that [Orven] sent to us to help experienced soldier. Now to you 
it is necessary to battle with the creatures, which creep out from the lair Of [shilen], together with us. Other questions?
