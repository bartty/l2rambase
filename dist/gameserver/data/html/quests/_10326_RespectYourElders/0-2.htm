NO I'M NOT OKAY! OW! Don't make me shout!

I was organizing the... documents in our 
old storage rooms, lifting up whole tomes 
with my magic. But... ow ow ow... okay... 
but they'd not been moved for years, and 
had quite a collection of dust covering 
them. The dust was getting thrown up everywhere, 
then I... I sneezed, and everything came crashing 
down around me. Around me, and on me.

And I had something important to tell Pantheon...
Sigh...
