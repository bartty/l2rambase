Gerkenshtein:
<br>
I believe I have another lead. The path that 
leads to the Imperial Tomb, do you know of it? It 
seems that the creatures there are not the same 
as the creatures that used to guard that path.
<br>
The creatures are... different. I cannot be certain, 
but some of these creatures have a strange aura 
to them. I need to know more to be certain 
though.It might be worth looking further into see 
if there is a connection between these new 
creatures and Shilen.
