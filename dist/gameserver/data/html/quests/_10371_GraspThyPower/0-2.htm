Gerkenshtein:
<br>
As I was saying, yes these creatures are quite 
different that the ones who used to roam the 
area. My Cryptozoology is a bit rusty, but it 
appears they are a rare species of Succubus. 
These creatures do not appear to have any of the 
traditional characteristics of a true Succubus with 
the exception of their one desire to drain the life 
out of you. Again, I would like for you to find out 
if these cratures are here due Shilen.
<br>
I`m afraid it this task isn`t as easy as watching 
elpies. It requires a bit more of a hands-on 
approach. I need you to kill a fair amount of 
these Succubus creatures and observe their 
reactions.
