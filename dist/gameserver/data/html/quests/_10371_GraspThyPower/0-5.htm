I do not believe you have not completed your quest 
yet.
<br>
You probably haven`t killed enough *Succubus* 
*Soldiers, Succubus Warriors, Succubus Archers,* 
*and Succubus Shamans*. Or maybe you are 
having a bit of difficulty with the *Bloody Succubi*.
Either way, there`s still more work that needs to 
be done.
<br>
Oh and don`t forget, if *anything strange* happens, 
to you be sure and take note of it.
