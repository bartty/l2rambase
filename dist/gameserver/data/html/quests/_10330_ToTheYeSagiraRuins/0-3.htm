Atran:
<br>
Well then, it is my duty to help you 
as much as I can.
<br>
To get to the ruins, follow the path you came, only 
in the opposite direction. Walk until you meet 
*Lakcis* - he stands at the *Ruins of Ye Sagira Entrance*.
<br>
He's a scholar, so can't go into Ruins of Ye Sagira. 
Go help him.
