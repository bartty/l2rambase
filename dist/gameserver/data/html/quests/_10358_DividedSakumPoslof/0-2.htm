<html><head><body>Guard Lef:<br>The best way to describe it is Poslof is a portion of Sakum that is able to exist on its own. Bad news is that it isn’t just one of them… we are receiving reports from guards in other locations of multiple Poslof sightings.<br>Kind of a bad day to find out that your only problem just turned into several problems.

I don’t suppose you would be interest in de-raging the rampaging creatures in the area until I can find out where Poslof is?<br>[Quest _10358_DividedSakumPoslof quest_ac|"It sounds like fun."]</body></html>
