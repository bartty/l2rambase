The gods? Take a moment to reflect on the gods, <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Gran
    Kain</font>, and their ilk. Think upon the origins of the gods, their abilities and their inabilities. All the gods
are capable are creation and destruction... that is it. And, they do it indiscriminately.<br>
Theyâ€™re like children who build cities in the sand only to destroy them... for the sheer joy of creation and
destructions. Do they ever for once do anything other than repeat this cycle? The Giants wanted to change all that. They
felt that everything that existed in the world had a purpose and a right to exist. People believe that the beginning and
end simply because they were here first... What kind of reasoning is that?<br>
Look around you... our world is collapsing into chaos and we are at the end of this cycle. The gods have sent in their
destructor. Shilen will destroy this world so that the gods may start again. Why do you think they are not doing
anything to stop her? They are simply just sitting and waiting... there is no interest in saving what is already here.
How about you? Can you just sit here and wait for the world to come to an end?<br>
