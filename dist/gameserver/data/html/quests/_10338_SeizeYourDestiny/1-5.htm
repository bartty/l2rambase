I know you have heard the masterâ€™s call. Only a part of his soul was free but the rest remains by the seal of light
within the <font color="LEVEL">Disconnected Labyrinth</font> of Ye Sagira Ruins. The ghost of the Ancient Giant King
<font color="LEVEL">Harnak</font> serves as the warden of the prison where Hermuncus is held. You will face the ghosts
of giants corrupted by the light. Defeat Harnak and the seal will be completely broken freeing the soul of
Hermuncus.<br>
Once Hermuncus has been freed, he will instruct you on how to acquire the power that the ancient giants once used.<br>
