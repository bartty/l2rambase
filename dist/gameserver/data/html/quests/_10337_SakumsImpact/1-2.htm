Sakum? Yes, that creature has been sighted in the Ruins of Despair. Why do you think I haven't been able to sleep in days? I'm afraid I can't help you with your task... I can barely swing my sword correctly.<br>
Additionally, my guards need to defend this location so I can't send anyone to assist you.<br>
