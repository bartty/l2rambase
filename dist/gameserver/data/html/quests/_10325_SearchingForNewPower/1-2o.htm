Perfect Herz:
<br>
Welcome, warrior of flame. I am Herz, the Orc 
race trainer. Listen up! I`ll exlain the 
characteristics and skills of Orc race classes to 
you.
<br>
*Orc Fighters* have fast and good physical and 
Mana healings, making long battles possible.
<br>
Even though an *Orc Mystic* uses magic, the class 
also has warrior abilities. We are Orcs, after all.
<br>
When your abilities improve, and you have new 
skills that you can learn, the *Skill Window will* 
*automatically* appear. You can check the list of 
skills that you have by using the shortcut keys 
*ALT+K*.
