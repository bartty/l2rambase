Master Talbot:
<br>
Welcome!
<br>
I am Talbot, human skillmaster, have to explain 
the benefits and drawbacks of the classes we 
can choose from.
<br>
*Human Fighters* mainly employ short-range 
melee attacks, and can handle most basic 
weapons and armor types.
<br>
*Human Mages* have an innate affinity for the 
power of the spoken word. They use Elemental 
Magic, White Magic, Supplemental Magic, Dark 
Magic and Summon Magic!
<br>
As your strength grows, you`ll notice a *Skill* 
*Window automatically show up* from time to 
time. You can also use the shortcut key *ALT+K* to 
check out the skills you already know.
