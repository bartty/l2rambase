Blacksmith Kincaid:
<br>
I`m Kincaid responsible for teaching the dwarven 
race. I`ll tell you about characteristics and slills 
of certain dwarven classes, so listen closely.
<br>
The *Dwarven fighter* crafts items from materials 
acquired from monsters. If you want to improve 
your power with pure capital, this would be the 
class fo you.
<br>
And yes, you`ll have new skills. Your skill window 
will *open automatically* when you press *ALT+K*, 
showning the full list of skills you have.
