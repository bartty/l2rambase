Master Black:
<br>
Welcome! My name is Black and I am a 
skillmaster to the Dark Elves.
<br>
I want to take a minute to tell you about the 
different classes I train.
<br>
*Dark Fighters* fight extremely quickly thanks to 
their high Atk and Evasion rates.
<br>
*Dark Mages* have powerful M. Atk and high 
Healing abilities.
<br>
As you gain new levels stronger skills 
become available a *Skill Window icon will* 
*automatically appear*. Click it to open your Skills 
Windows. Futhermore, you can open your Skills 
Windows by pressing *ALT+K*, to see your Active, 
Passive, and Skills you can learn.
