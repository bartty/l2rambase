!Training Newbie Helper:
<br>
Do you feel that? Even though you are still using 
the same armor and weapons you are now 
significantly more powerful than you were. 
*Newbie Helpers* can provide you with 
supplemental magic that will increase your stats 
(You should see several Buff Icons displayed 
near your Character Information Window in the 
Upper Left Hand Corner of the Screen). 
<br>
However, these powers are only temporary. When 
it disappears, look for Newbie Helpers in towns. 
We'll help you whenever you want. Once you get 
stronger and venture out to more dangerous 
area, you won't find that many Newbie Helpers, 
but Adventurer Helpers in towns can also provide 
you with the same beneficial magic! 
<br>
Enough talk, go ahead and give that Scarecrow a 
few more whacks. You'll see you will be able to 
demolish it much faster.
