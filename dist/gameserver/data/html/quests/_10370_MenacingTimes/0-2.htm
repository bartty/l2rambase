Grand Magister Winonin:
<br>
The Aden Vanguard reports they have spotted 
several of *Shilen`s creatures* entering Aden 
Territory from *Goddard*. They do not believe that 
there is another attack planed for Aden but 
more of an impending attack on Goddard.
<br>
If this is correct, then we might be able to 
pinpoint the source of where and how Shilen is 
able to send her creatures in Aden. The first 
priority is to alert Goddard that Shilen`s creatures 
are preparing to attack Goddard.
<br>
Will you go to Goddard and give them this 
information?
