Exellent. Give me a moment to perform some 
quick tests. Well I have good news and bad 
news. The good news is that I was able to verify 
that this is the *Remnant Ashes* normal creatures. 
The bad news is that it does nithing to further 
my investigation...
<br>
This investigation is pretty much at a dead end. I 
do wish to thank you for your assistance. At least 
we can prove that these creatures have not been 
corrupted by Shilen`s influence. Here is a little 
something for your efforts. I do have a few other 
thing that could use your attention.
