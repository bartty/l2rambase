Captain Andrei:
<br>
So, you will help us then? Good. I need to deliver 
this news to my susperiors to see what can be 
done around here.
<br>
I sent a reconnaissance team to the *Shrine of* 
*Loyalty* to investigate the new activity in the 
area. I believe you can find a man by the name 
of *Gerkenshtein*. He is the lead investigator on 
that team and should be able to brief you on the 
activity in that area. Hopefully you will be able to 
find the source of Shilen`s creature entering our 
world.
<br>
Now then, if you will excuse me I have to tell my 
susperios we should be expecting some 
unwelcome guests soon.
