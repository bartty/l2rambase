Gerkenshtein:

Quickly, you have to hunt down *Scavenger* 
*Scarabs, Scavenger Ants, and Shrine Knights*  and 
bring me back samples of their *Remnant Ashes*. 
To be on the safe side, please bring back 30 
samples. They are already in the area so we 
must be quick before Shilen sends in her 
creations. Once I have these samples, it will help 
me determine if there is a threat to Goddard 
here or not.
