Captain Andrei:
<br>
Hmmm... this comes from the Aden Vanguard? Yes, 
I had my suspicions that Goddard may be in 
danger. There has been a lot of *strange activities* 
in the Goddard territory. However, since Shilen 
has invaded our world that is somewhat of an 
understatement. There is something strange 
anywhere you look now.
<br>
I hope you are up for more of a challenge than 
just delivering this message to us. Several of 
Goddard`s forces are out on missions and we are 
short on manpower here. We`re looking for 
anyone who can swim a sword or cast a spell.
