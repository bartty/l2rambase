Captain Bathis:
<br>
Nemertess? Yeees, I've heard about him. He was
interrupted while trying to hatch Sakum. I
sent him to the continent.
<br>
We've been seing Sakum around, sporadically.
It' doesn't appear to be under anyone's control,
but it's so fast... we haven't managed to get
close enough to tell what condition it's in. And
now, we can't even find it! We need to track it
down, it's just not safe having it running around.
