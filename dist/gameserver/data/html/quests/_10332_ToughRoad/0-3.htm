Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:
<br>
Lord Lewin Waldner of Gludio Castle is an old
friend of mine, but I can't abandon my duties here
to go help him. Since I can't go, I'd like to send
someone I trust. You.
<br>
You can head right over there. Just go to the
*Center of the town of Gludio*, through
*Gatekeeper Melia*, (who's by the left museum path).
Once you arrive, go see *Captain Bathis* and
give him this letter of introduction. He'll be
able to fill you in the latest of Sakum sightnings.
<br>
May the Flame of Pa'agrio follow you, always!
