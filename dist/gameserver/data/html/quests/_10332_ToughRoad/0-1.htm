Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:
<br>
You've hear that *Sakum*, disappeared into the labyrinth, right? Well,
it looks like he's come back out. I've been getting reports of Sakum
sightings all around Aden. Some of them are probably cases
of nervous people and moving shadows, but they can't all be incorrect.
In fact, Lord Lewin Waldner of Gludio has requested that we send troops.
<br>
I'd like to assign you this task. Are you willing to go?
<br>
