Nagel:
<br>
How long will I have to stay here?
<br>
I don't mind the days, but at night, 
this place gets decidedly creepy. You 
know that the monsters here were created 
from the ashes of the dead townspeople, 
right? You know that they are death personified, 
and exist only to murder and maim?
<br>
Why did you come here?
