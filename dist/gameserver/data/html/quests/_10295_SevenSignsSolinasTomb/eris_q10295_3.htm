Sister of Silence Eris:

Everyone who enters the Solina of rest, except the creators of the print engine - Eris Kaeruna and Anais are considered invaders. But I'm just a spirit that can not leave this room, so I can not help. You just have to destroy the print. To do this you will have to combat the four Guardians of Treasures.
