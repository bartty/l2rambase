!Saint of the abyss Of [elkardiya]:

I searched for information about this before the book, found by us before the library runes. And I found here this inscription: ““When you go around around the monastery and will appear way leading beside the library it will be possible to reveal special device moving beside the cell Of [nastoyatelnitsy]”. So there it is written.

To us to there remains only reveal this device. We can leave the monastery of silence directly now. I think, [V] easily against everything you will be dismantled. I will follow you. As you will be finished, leave at the point of the searches.
