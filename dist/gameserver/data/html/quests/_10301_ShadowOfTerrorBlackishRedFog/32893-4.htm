! Hierarch Slaski:

I do not know for sure. More ... I only know that he appeared at a time when the Colony Fay and the Garden of Genesis sported plenty more kind and gentle animals.

Maybe later there appeared some sort of negative energy? I can not go in there - I'm afraid.
Do I need to go with you, here there is also the Tetrarch Fairies, and they have an elite bodyguards.
