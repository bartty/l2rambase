! Hierarch Slaski:

Oh! It's Visp! How did you manage to get it, because they are found only in the Colony Fey? VISP just needed us! The first cure diseases!

All right. You gave me Visp, this is a very generous gift. In gratitude, I will answer your question. What are you interested in a dark red mist?
