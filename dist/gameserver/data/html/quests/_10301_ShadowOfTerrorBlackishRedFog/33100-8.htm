! Magmeld Emissary Leader Lada:

Nicely, that you agreed! Then immediately go to the entrance of the cave
<font color="LEVEL"> for Angelic Falls </font> and
Find <font color="LEVEL"> Huge Green Forest, which is like Swamp Spirits </font>.
Try using this one <font color="LEVEL"> Shimmering Crystal </font>. they
made of mica, produced in Magmelde. So, in Aden can not get anything like this.

If you use sparkling crystals will start around
gather <font color="LEVEL"> Swamp Spirits </font>.

Catch the Swamp Ghost, and bring it to SLAC in Ancient City Arkan.
Then the Elder will be favorable to you.

Cats are very suspicious, so you do not manage to find out if you come up empty-handed.
