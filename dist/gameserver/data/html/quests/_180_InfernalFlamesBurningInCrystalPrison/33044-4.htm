![Fioren]:

Now crystal labyrinth is located before the hands of the demons caused By [belefom] and [Baylora], which leads them. I think, they attempt to secure the force Of [fafuriona] with the aid of the gem Of [fanariona], which is located before the depth of crystal labyrinth. And demons, and 
the myrmidons Of [shilen] present for us huge threat, but 
if they can wake up [Fanarion]â€¦ [O], with this misfortune, I think, 
to us it will not manage. It is necessary to as soon as possible stop [Baylora] and its demons. 

I please, help me.
