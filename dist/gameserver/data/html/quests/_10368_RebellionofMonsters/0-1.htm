Guard Fred:
<br>
The biggest problem is the appearance of the 
Ancient Monster Sakum. The native monsters 
have become agitated by his arrival, and many 
have become much stringer, while others have 
come from the depths of the world itself!
<br>
Sigh.. The are too many monsters, and not 
enough warriors. We need help.
