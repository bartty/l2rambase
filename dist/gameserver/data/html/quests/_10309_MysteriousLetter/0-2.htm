Adventurer Helper:
<br>
It is nothing too difficult... all you need to do is 
visit *Armor Merchant Alisia in Rune Township* and 
collect a letter to deliver to someone... she didn`t 
list who you would be delivering the letter to. 
Yes, I suppose she could use the mail system 
hust like everyone else, but she has requested a 
more physical presence to attend to the matter. 
Still interested?
