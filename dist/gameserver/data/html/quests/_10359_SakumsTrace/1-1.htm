Guard Fred:
<br>
I`ve heard that an Adventure Guildsman from 
Gludio sent a great adventurer here. Was that 
person you?
<br>
I know that you were sent by the Adventure 
Guildsman, but I don`t wnow if I can trust you... 
<br>
Don`t feel to bad about that - I`m looking out for 
your back as well as mine.
<br>
