Guard Fred:
<br>
I wouldn`t say monsters in the Wasteland were 
ever very docile, but they look different now. 
They became more powerful that before, too.
<br>
And recently I was investigating this area and 
found a suspicius looking fragment from the 
carcass of monster. Maybe it`s because the 
monster has been dead for a long time, but the 
fragment was too small for me to identify. 
<br>
Could you help to discover what it might be?
<br>
