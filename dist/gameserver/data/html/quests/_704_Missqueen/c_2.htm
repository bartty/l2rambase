!Adventurer's Guide Miss Queen:

Do you like your adventure? Here's a weapon exchange coupon.

This coupon allows you to get a D-Grade weapon warehouse Adventurer's Guild. This coupon can not be given, change, etc., and you are responsible for loss of, or damage to it, or arms.

You can only take in Orenda weapon until you reach level 25. And if you did not quite the right choice of weapon, you can change it to a weapon with another coupon. Good luck!
