![Tetrarkh] of Fairy- refugees To [noeti] [Mimirid]:

Destroy <font color="LEVEL">[Kokony]</font> and <font color="LEVEL">[Ogromnye] Of [kokony]</font> 
before the colony of fairies. Certainly, destruction of the cocoons of much will not give to us - fairies will no longer become previous, 
and new cocoons will appear against the trees.

But we cannot sit idly. We will [neustanno] fight with the cocoons, and sooner or later 
our misfortunes will pass.
