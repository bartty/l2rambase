It is clear that Vallok is much stronger and more dangerous than Baylor, whom you fought earlier. 
But I believe that for you, nothing is impossible. After all, you have already proven that you do not give up under any circumstances. 
What is it? Go. Meanwhile, I will pray for your victory. By the way ... After killing Vallok bring his sign.
