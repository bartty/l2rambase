Calling all adventurers! Dolphren is lookinf for 
brave warriors to help collect research materials! 
Listen in for details.

Research on the Giant relics is progressing at a 
somewhat slower pace than expected, as our

emerging monster threats and ongoing wars. To 
help, Dolphren has suggested concentrating on 
the *Silent Valley* and has offered significant 
compensation for all those who agree to help!
