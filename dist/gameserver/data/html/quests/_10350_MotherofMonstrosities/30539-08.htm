Great! So, everything is very simple. <font color="LEVEL">If our plan works </font>, then <font color="LEVEL"> Daychir Priest of the Earth</font> will help you get into the cave <font color="LEVEL"> earthworm </ font>. You will need to enter the place to come together in a battle with earthworms and bring part of his body as evidence of the death of a monster. <br>
This is a request of the Priests of the Earth ... No, all the Dwarves! I understand, be in the hands of the corpse of the creature ... it must be disgusting. But think of it as another test. <br>
Karna Maphr! May God bless you Goddess of the Earth!
