Although the earthworm is mighty and formidable, we are relying on the technology of the Dwarves and assistance of all other races are making attempts to destroy it. You ... I think you're ready to get together with him in battle. Once you have gathered to fight for our world, you will certainly need to combat the earthworm Trask. <br>
I ask you to give me one promise. Say what you will always remember their responsibilities to this world! Give an oath that will carry them out! And then I have a calm heart will direct you to the job. <br>
