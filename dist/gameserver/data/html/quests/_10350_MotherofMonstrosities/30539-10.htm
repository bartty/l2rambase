So, you brought the body of the worm ... You have to understand that I gave you this job is not for the reason that we are not able to cope with the Worm. I'm just like you accomplished a feat, which would remember the rest of his days! <br>
Of course, if you want to Shilen, earthworms come to life again, and will sow destruction ... But we stopped him for a while. This is something so worthwhile. Another obstacle to the unholy Shilen. <br>
Let the lady will protect you in your travels! Train, grows stronger! And come back when you become a brave warrior, able to protect our world! May God bless you to the earth goddess <font color="LEVEL">Maphr</font> ...</body></html>
