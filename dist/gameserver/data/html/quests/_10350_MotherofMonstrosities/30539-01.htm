Our mistress has given us the ordeal! Goddess of Destruction Shilen, using the magic of death, resurrected an earthworm Trask, sealed Lucien. Destroyed the village, many of our countrymen died. <br>
However, we, the Dwarves, are not easy to break! We know that whoever believes in Goddess of the Earth <font color="LEVEL">Maphr</font> and it will be, will find salvation! Under the auspices of the goddess we overcome these adversities. <br>
What's up to you ... Are you confident in their abilities, as well as we? <br>
