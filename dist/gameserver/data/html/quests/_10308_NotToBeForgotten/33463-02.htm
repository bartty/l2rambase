The population of monsters in the Forsaken Plains is overwhelming and as a result causing monsters to spread out into more peaceful areas. Captain Kurtiz is looking for anyone willing to venture to the Forsaken Plains to eliminate the monsters and keep the population in control.<br>
The creatures that are of concern that need to be eliminated are Marsh Stalkers, Marsh Drakes, Fallen Orcs, Ancient Gargoyles, Fallen Orc Archers, Sharp Talon Tigers, Fallen Orc Shamans, and Fallen Orc Captains. Some, but not all, have been collecting Legacy Cores. Collect 40 Legacy Cores and then speak with Captain Kurtiz in the Town of Aden.<br>
