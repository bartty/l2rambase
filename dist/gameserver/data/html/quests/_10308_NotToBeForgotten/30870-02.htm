Let's see here... 37, 38, and 39 it looks like you are 1 short. No wait a minute, there it is. 40 Legacy Cores. I ship these to the Wizard Guild to see if they can analyze why the creatures in Forsaken Plains seem to be drawn to these rocks and if they hold any beneficial properties we can use.<br>
I suppose you didn't do this out of the kindness in your heart and are looking for your reward. Here you go... if it isn't beneath your skills yet you can see the Adventurer Helper again if you want more work.<br>
