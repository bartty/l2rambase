Alright. Just to recap everything that was just said... eliminate Marsh Stalkers, Marsh Drakes, Fallen Orcs, Ancient Gargoyles, Fallen Orc Archers, Sharp Talon Tigers, Fallen Orc Shamans, and Fallen Orc Captains and collect 40 Legacy Cores. Once you have completed that, speak with Captain Kurtiz in the Town of Aden, who will reimburse you for your efforts.<br>
