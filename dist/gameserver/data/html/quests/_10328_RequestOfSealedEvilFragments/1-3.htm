Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:

Hmm, good idea. Sealing it is probably safer 
than destroying it. This stuff tends to cause 
quite the explosion if you mess up when trying 
to destroy it. I can weave the power of Pa'agrio 
around it. That should make a sufficient seal. 
Nasty piece of work.

Did you know that these things were parasitic? Yah. 
There's been an influx of Evil Fragments in Ruins of 
Ye Sagira. When anyone dies out there, the pieces 
latch on to the corpse. Gross. But it's even worse 
when they latch on to living bodies! We've had a few 
outbreaks in the village lately. The damage those 
things inflict is incredible and down right disturbing!
