Pantheon:
<br>
Well, we don't know when the monster will 
hatch, so we want you to destroy it as soon 
as possible! Asterios, the head of the elves, 
is away, so the only one that can seal the seed 
is Kakai, leader of the Orcs.
<br>
We want you to take the seed to *Flame Lord Kakai*, 
he's in the Administration Office.
