Weaver Olf Adams:

Recently, our weavers' guild learned how to imbed the souls of monsters into the clothes that we make.

This method allows us to make clothes that are far superior, and gives the wearer a monster-like appearance.

If you can collect souls of boss monsters, I can make you a new cloak. Interested?
