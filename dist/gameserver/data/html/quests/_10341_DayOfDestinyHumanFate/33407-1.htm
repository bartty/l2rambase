!Quartermaster:

Together with his men vanguard Adolf is fierce battles with monsters,
make a breakthrough and attacking Aden. With our victory today vanguard sent to the base of the monsters
but in the course of the battle, many were killed.

He who hesitates is lost, and as it is not sad, we do not even have time to gather with family heirlooms phone to send their heirs in the metropolis.
I ask you to collect the Graveyard 4 relics from the bodies of fallen fighters of the avant-garde of Aden and bring them to me.

The bodies of fighters scattered throughout the cemetery area, so we were not able to find out their
the exact location, but it seems necessary to examine the site, the corners of which form
The central fountain, statues of angels and the Pagoda.
