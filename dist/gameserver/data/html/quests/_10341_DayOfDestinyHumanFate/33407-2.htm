!Quartermaster:

I ask you to collect the Graveyard 4 relics from the bodies of fallen fighters of the avant-garde of Aden and bring them to me.

The bodies of fighters scattered throughout the cemetery area, so we were not able to find out their
the exact location, but it seems necessary to examine the site, the corners of which form
The central fountain, statues of angels and the Pagoda.
