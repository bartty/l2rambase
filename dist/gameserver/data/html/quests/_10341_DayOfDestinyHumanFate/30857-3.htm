!High Priest Orven:

You probably know about a place called Forbidden Gateway to the outpost of Aden.
It is now filled with dark energy, due to the fact that the Goddess of Death turned to the Gates
his gaze. And the new evil spirits Elder waiting for an opportunity to attack Aden.

Our brave vanguard of Aden found in the dungeon lair of evil creatures and tried it
destroy. Braves were missing, and we were going to send a scouting party
them to help. It would be nice if you could take up the case.
