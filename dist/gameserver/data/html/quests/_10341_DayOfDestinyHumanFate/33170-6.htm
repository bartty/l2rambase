!Head Vanguard Aden Adolf:

This ring I received from Orvena. He commanded me
lend it to someone I would have found enough
able for the upcoming battle.

This chudestnoe ring that awakens hidden
the ability of the owner. It is worth to you to put it on, and
You will be able to use part of the enormous
power that you have to get
afterwards.

So, if you are ready, try to fully
put an end to the constant influx of evil spirits.
