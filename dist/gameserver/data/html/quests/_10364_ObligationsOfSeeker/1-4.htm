Walter:

Ah, it's not so difficult. Old *pieces of paper* 
have been appearing around here. I'm not 
sure what they're regarding, but Dep likes 
this kind of stuff.
<br>
I want you to gather 
5 or so, then hand them to *Dept* in 
*Exploration Area 4*
<br>
You'll find the pieces of paper by defeating 
the *Husk Kraphers and Husk Avians*.
<br>
And... say hi to him for me, okay?
