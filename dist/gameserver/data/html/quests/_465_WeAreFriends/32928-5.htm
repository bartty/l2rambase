!Fairy- townsman:

Oho!Here this it is completely sufficient.

Thus, listen to.

[Kimerian] deceives travellers with the aid of the sly illusions. If you and actually 
you want to meet for the sake of it, without fail take with itself comrades. No one not under the force 
to overcome [Kimeriana] beside the lone person.
I feel before you something similarâ€¦ I think, you are capable of conquering it. I will give thing to you, 
which will help to separate illusion based on reality and will allow you to meet [Kimerianom] face to face.
But indeed you do want to be slain with it by itself, but not with one of his specters?
