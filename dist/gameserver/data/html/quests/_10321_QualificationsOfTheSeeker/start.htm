Theodore:

Haa... There are so many things to do 
around here! There's one problem here, 
and there another problem... I get a 
steady influx of rangers, but the pile 
of work just gets higher and higher. 
I'm not sure there are enough Rangers 
in the world to tackle this amount of 
work...
