Mentor Helper:
<br>
A Mentor can help guide 3 Mentees simultaneously.
As a Mentee levels, the Mentor will receive a mail containing Mentee Coin.
This can be exchanged for items though Mentor Guides located across Aden.
<br>
At levels 1-50, a Mentor will receive a mail at every 10 levels (10, 20, 30, 40, & 50).
After level 50, a Mentor will receive a mail each time the Mentee levels up until they graduate and the bond is removed.
After receiving the Mentee Coin and it is successfully placed in your inventory it is a good idea to delete the mail.
If your mailbox is full, mail does not get delivered and you cannot receive the items.
<br>
When both the Mentor and Mentee are online they receive a beneficial buff.
Additionally, you will receive a XP/SP bonus buff.
<br>
When a Mentee has reached level 85 and completed their 4th Class Awakening quest, the Mentee Certificate can be exchanged for Diploma.
These can then be exchanged for Requiem Weapons or Immortal Armor and Jewels.
