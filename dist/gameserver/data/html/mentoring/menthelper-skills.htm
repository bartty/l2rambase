Mentor Helper:
<br>
Becoming a mentor, you can teach your mentee important skills. <br>
However, if the mentor or mentee will be far from each other, it will be difficult to teach.
For convenience, the mentee has the ability to summon his mentor. <br>
See in the Skills window under clans/heroes/mentors.
