Diary of Lydia:<br>

The thirtieth day of the month of Shilen.<br><br>

Tomorrow is an important day!
I must talk with the Father.
The word Nidrah'a now has too much value!<br>

Royal guide Run'y missed for ages, and something had to happen!
Brother Eilhalder said our family should first stand on a sewn Run'y, not the royal family!<br>

I'm not sure and I do not believe in all this...<br>

Nidrah came to me this evening.
He told me that no matter what I decided, I must always show their courage during the terrible time.
What did he mean by that?
I was always brave!<br>
