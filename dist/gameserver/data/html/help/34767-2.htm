Gerkenshtein`s Report:
<br>
The seek to seize the power of the gods. 
Legend speak of sacred relic of Einhasad 
being hidden from long ago in the territory of 
Goddard. I believe that evil creatures have 
appeared in order to seize that relic and to gain 
its power.
<br>
In other words, they are gathering items that 
contain the power of the gods, and delivering 
them to a puppet, who in turn delivers them to 
Shilen! Stopping them is the key to preventing 
devastation.
