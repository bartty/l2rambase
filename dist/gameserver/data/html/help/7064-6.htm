Diary of Lydia:<br>

Twenty-fourth day of Shilen.<br><br>

Fast deliver my invitation to Nidrah, and it took far too easy!<br>

I had been prepared in such a hurry when he arrives!
I had to make a thousand mistakes, but he did not say anything!
He was too nice?
Or maybe he just does not care!<br>

and this case is nothing to do with our family.<br>
