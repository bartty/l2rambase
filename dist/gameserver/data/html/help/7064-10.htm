Diary of Lydia:<br>

I do not know why I'm here!
It seems he knows all my most secret secrets!
He asked me what I did not want to leave.
I was careful with him, but I can not remember what I said.
All that was... I lost it!
Make that really happen?
He asks that I have given all of myself to this!
He accused me of betraying my family, my life, my god, and even the natural law!
