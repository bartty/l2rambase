Gray Pillar Kantarubis:

A glimmer is a jelly-like blob, it's basically solidifed life energy. It can only be found in this world.<br>

Glimmer means life, can be used as food, and is sometimes exchanged like money. Curious stuff.<br>

You used to be able to buy it from the fairies, but some strange stuff's been going on with the faires lately, and it's
way harded to find any glimmer to buy now days.
