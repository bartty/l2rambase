Kartia Researcher:
<br>
Do you know of the Dimensional Rift? 
In addition to the physical world we inhabit, there are many different physical worlds that exist in different dimensions. 
No direct path between the dimensions existed before, but with the waking of the Goddess of Destruction, the boundaries between the dimensions became distorted.<br>
Kartia's Labyrinth is a strategic stronghold in the Dimensional Rift, ruled by three powerful demons selected by the Goddess of Destruction herself.<br>
