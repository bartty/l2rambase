Newbie Helper:
<br>May Einhasad's light protect you! It is my responsibility to advise new adventurers.
<br>The power of evil is growing day by day, friend. We hear tales of unending wars, and 
-- most ominous of all -- even the powers of Dawn and Dusk struggle for supremacy... 
You will need all your strength and skill to survive in such a dangerous world. Please pay 
heed to my advice...
