!Newbie Guide:

Welcome! I can see you are new here! I represent the Bronze Key Guild, Our guild collects items, and we instruct young adventurers who wish to someday go on great journeys like the heroes of the ancient sagas.

As you gain experience, I'll have new teaching for you. So if you wish your name to be as a hero here in the Spine Mines, come back to me when you reach Levels 6,11 and 16!
