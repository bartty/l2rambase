Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>
If your subclass is strong enough, that 
class' power can be transferred to your 
main class.<br>

But this is a dangerous feat. Your 
power must be proven through 
certification.<br>

If you have a certificate, I will do a 
partial transfer on you.<br>

Now, will you learn the subclass skills 
transferred onto the main class?<br>

[npc_%objectId%_subclass_CertificationSkillList|"Yup, I'll learn it."]<br>

[npc_%objectId%_Chat 8|"I have to learn more stuff? No thanks..."]
