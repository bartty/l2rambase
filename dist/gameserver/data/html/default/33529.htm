Dion Auction House Manager:
Welcome, adventurer.

I'm an auction house manager dispatched from the Kingdom of Aden. Do you know about the Auction House?
Simply put, it allows you to purchase tens of thousands of goods registered from all over the continent.

And if you have any items to sell yourself, you can of course put them up for sale by registering them with us.
Leave the items that you wish to sell with me, and when they are sold to other customers who desire them I'll transfer the proceeds to you. You could carve out handsome profits from selling rare and precious items.

However, there's a *certain transaction fee* you must pay to use our system.
What do you think? Are you interested in using our services?
