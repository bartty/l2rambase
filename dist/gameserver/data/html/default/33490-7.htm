You can obtain new powers if <font color="LEVEL">your main 
class and dual class both exceed level 85.</font><br1>
You can't get these powers unless you 
are certified with your dual class and 
main class.
<font color="LEVEL">I'll help you obtain new powers if you 
have the certificates.</font><br1>
So, will you give me that dual class 
certificate and acquire the power 
contained within
