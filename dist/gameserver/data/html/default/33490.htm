Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>

Discipline and endless training to bring your subclass up 
to a certain level open your eyes to new powers.<br1>
Now, let's see how much your training has taught you.<br1>
By the way, to receive this certification, <font color="LEVEL">
your current class must be the class of the subclass or dual 
class you want to be certified for; 
you also need to be level 65 or above, and 
in the case of the dual class, level 85 
or above.<br1></font>
So, do you want to be certified? Or do 
you want to learn skills with the 
certification you received?<br>
