Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>

Dual class certification can be done 
when <font color="LEVEL">your main and dual class levels 
both hit 85, 90, 95, and 99.</font> You can 
get certificates by getting certified for 
each of them, and with the certificates, 
you get to learn skills.<br><br>

Remember; <font color="LEVEL">skills you learned through 
dual certification only apply to main class and dual class.</font>
