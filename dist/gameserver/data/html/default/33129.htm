<html><head><body>Magmeld Emissary Prieta:<br>
A long, long time ago, there were heroes who were chosen by gods, and there were those who weren't. Their tales were buried as forgotten legends, and not many remember them now. I also thought it was some old story.<br>
But I learned the truth behind that old story when I was in Magmeld. Leader Lada also wanted to hurry back after learning that terrifying truth.<br>
Have you seen Magmeld Delegation Leader Lada in Hunters Village yet?<br>
