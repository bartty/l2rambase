Subclass/Dual Class Master Raina:<br>

To do the dual class rewakening needs a extraordinary power of the titans. Fortunally, they share his powers to me and i can use them to help the adventurers with strong training to discover new ultimate powers.<br>

However, the materials for produce this change are extremly rare. This may be more powerful if you current dual class has low levels. The cost for these magic materials depending of the level are the follows:<br>

<center><table>
	<tr><td width=100><center>Level</center></td><td width=100><center>Cost</center></td></tr>
	<?COST?>
</table></center>

<font color="LEVEL">Your current dual class cloak has been taken on the process and a new class cloak of target dual class are been given to you</font>.<br>

<font color="LEVEL">All Dual Class Certificate skills are removed on this change, included the not learned dual certificates</font>, this may affect only on the Dual Skills, subclass skills is isn't affected.<br>

At last, your new dual class level has been setted to 85.
