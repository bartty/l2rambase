!Newbie Guide:

Good day, friend. I now live peacefully here on this island, but once I was a well-known adventure. Why, I ventured into the deepest part of Dragon Valley with Sir Cedric, brother of Roien.

Today, my time is spent guiding novices, If you have any questions, please come and ask me. I will teach you as much as I can.
