Subclass Master Raina:<br>
For the power of the gods it is necessary to have the certificate of the change of occupation. Certificate of the change of occupation was issued heroes long before the fall of Shilen. Sorry, but now it is out of reach.

But if You still get the certificate of the change of occupation, come able to subclass to receive the force of the gods.
