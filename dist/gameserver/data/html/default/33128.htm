Magmeld Emissary:

I saw the beautiful creatures, the likes of which have not seen ever before! It was really an unforgettable sight!

Rada, the head of our delegation, bored and constantly start talking about going back. Willy-nilly, I had to obey, but I intend to spend more time in Magmelde when I go there next time.

Hmm? You ask, what is the Magmeld? Do you really have not heard anything about him?
