Selfin:

In the newborn the world there was no danger. Only the creation, light and chaos. But the indifference of the gods has created evil, gave rise to the darkness.
The gods did not control what is happening, because of the darkness and indifference has grown to epic proportions.

* We want to resurrect the Giants *. Only they can resist the gods and save the world. They fill all the meaning and create a world for all.
