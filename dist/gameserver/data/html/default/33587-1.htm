!Mentor Guide:
If you allow me to break the fourth wall for a moment, new or returning players who have not played Lineage II in awhile might find some aspects of the game have changed or are a bit challenging. 

The Mentor/Mentee system was designed to help anyone who is in that situation. 

A more experienced player will fill the role as the Mentor, while the new or inexperienced player will be the Mentee.
