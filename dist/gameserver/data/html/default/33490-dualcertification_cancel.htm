Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>

Dual class certification and skill learning are actually incredible feats.<br1>
As you may know from the subclass experience you had before, 
but it's not just about effort. The enormous pressure it puts on your soul 
is beyond your imagination.<br1>
I will be using special herbs again to 
seal the certified skills you learned.
This time though, the herb will cost you 
about <font color="LEVEL"><?COST?> million Adena.</font>. I have them 
handy, so just pay up and I can cancel that certification for you.<br1>
If you cancel the certification, <font color="LEVEL">your current 
certification status disappears, and all the certificates and sealbooks 
you didn't learn skills with will be deleted.</font><br1>
So...what you want to do?
