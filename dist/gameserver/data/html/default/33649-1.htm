Goddard Vanguard Sirik:
<br>
Oh you heard that. Yes. I am Sirik Ken Abygail. 
My father is Duke Mora Ken Abygail, the lord of 
Goddard. He is a noble knight and powerful 
warrior. However, I do not seem to have his 
courage. I joined the Vanguard in hopes that it 
would help me in finding my courage, but... well, 
no luck yet.
