I'm a royal token exchanger dispatched from the Kingdom of Aden. If you have <font color="LEVEL">Lord's Tokens</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Royal Tokens</font> acquired from undertaking various royal decrees, military expeditions or large-scale missions, I can exchange them for a range of useful presents.
