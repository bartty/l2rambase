Excuse me! I`m in the middle of something very 
important right now. How would you like it if tried 
to start some chit-chat whike you were in the 
middle of a fight? That would be pretty annoying, 
no? So unless you have something vitally 
important, I must ask that you gi and bother 
someone else becouse, as I have already 
mentioned, I am doing important... stuff!
