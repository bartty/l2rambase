Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:

Are you here to help me? Hm... you have an air of confidence about you, perhaps you will do. But you have to earn my trust, and I cannot promise you safety. Are you sure you want to become involved?

[npc_%objectId%_Quest|I will help you.]

[npc_%objectId%_ExitFromQuestInstance|I like to go outside.]
